## What is Ansible
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.Designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs in a way that approaches plain English.


## Use Cases

1. Exact date is mentioned for next episode.
   ```
    Example 'Flash'
    Status:  Next episode airs on <yyyy-mm-dd>
    ```
2. Only year is mentioned for next season.
    ```
    Example 'game of Thrones'
    Status: The next season begins in <yyyy>
    ```
3. All the seasons are finished and no further details are available.
    ```
    Example 'Friends'
    Status: The show has finished streaming all its episodes.
    ```
4. No Information about the next episode's release date is mentioned,so just notify about the latest release date
    ```
    Example 'Suits'
    Status: Latest episode was released on <yyyy-mm-dd>
    ```
